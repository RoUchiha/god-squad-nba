# God Squad — Context File for Future AI Chats

Paste this file at the start of any new conversation to give full project context.

---

## Project Summary
**God Squad** is a sports team-building browser game at `god-squad/` in the Documents repo.
Players draft historical athletes from a randomly assigned era+team combo, then simulate
a full professional season to try to go undefeated (82-0, 17-0, 162-0, or 82-0 depending on sport).

Inspired by 82-0.com and 20-0.com.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js 14** App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v3
- **Zod** for runtime validation on all API routes
- **No database** — game state is client-side only
- Port: `3001` (to avoid conflicts with other projects on 3000)

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **All secrets are server-side only** — stored in `.env.local` or Vercel environment variables
- **Input validation**: every API route validates params with Zod before any external call
- **Fallback data**: if external sports APIs fail, each `lib/sports/*.ts` generates plausible placeholder data so the game always works
- **No auth/database** — the game is stateless; no user accounts needed
- **GSPR algorithm**: in `lib/algorithms/powerRating.ts`. Uses era-normalized z-scores per stat, weighted by position. Scale 0–1000.
- **Season simulation**: in `lib/algorithms/simulator.ts`. Uses a power curve formula for win probability per game, with per-game variance. Calibrated so undefeated is ~5-25% at max GSPR.

## GSPR Formula (overview)
```
GSPR = (offScore × weight + defScore × weight + depthScore × 0.10 + chemistry × 0.05) × 10

Sport weights:
  NBA: offense 55%, defense 35%
  NFL: offense 45%, defense 45%
  MLB: offense 50%, pitching 40%
  NHL: offense 50%, defense 30% (+ goalie in defense bucket)

Scale: 0–1000
Tiers: Average (0–499), Good (500–699), Great (700–849), Legendary (850–949), God Squad (950+)
```

## Win Probability Formula
```typescript
winProb = base + range × (gspr/1000)^1.8

NBA: base=0.620, range=0.365  → max 0.985 at GSPR 1000
NFL: base=0.580, range=0.330  → max 0.910
MLB: base=0.560, range=0.432  → max 0.992
NHL: base=0.600, range=0.382  → max 0.982
```

## Sports APIs Used
| Sport | URL | Auth | Notes |
|-------|-----|------|-------|
| MLB | statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1 | None | Official, historical back to 1876 |
| NHL | api-web.nhle.com/v1 | None | Official |
| NBA | Curated data + ESPN current rosters | None | Validated historical rosters are bundled server-side |
| NFL | site.api.espn.com/... | None | Unofficial ESPN API |

## Eras Defined (in lib/constants.ts)
Each sport has 6 eras defined as static data. The API routes pick one randomly.
Era selection is done in `/api/era/[sport]` — it returns a random era + random team.

## Reroll System
Each game has exactly 3 one-time-use rerolls:
1. **Team Reroll** — same era, different team, clears drafted players
2. **Era Reroll** — completely new random era + team, clears everything
3. **Position Swap** — click a roster slot then pick a replacement from pool

## Roster Sizes
- NBA: 8 (5 starters + 3 bench)
- NFL Combined: 15 (7 offense + 8 defense)
- NFL Offense only: 7 | Defense only: 8
- MLB Combined: 13 (9 batters + 4 pitchers)
- NHL Combined: 9 (6 forwards + 2 D + 1 G)

## Environment Variables
```
CRON_SECRET=           # Required for the protected refresh route; minimum 32 characters
OPENAI_API_KEY=        # Optional server-only season explanations
OPENAI_MODEL=          # Optional; defaults to gpt-4o-mini
```

## Deployment
Vercel (free tier), connect GitHub repo, set env vars in dashboard.
Custom domain via Vercel: set DNS CNAME to cname.vercel-dns.com

## Known Limitations / Future Work
- NFL historical stats (pre-2000) use generated fallback data; ESPN API covers modern seasons
- NHL historical stats (pre-2010) may need fallback data
- No user accounts or leaderboard yet
- Could add: share results link, leaderboard, more sports (MLS, WNBA)
- App-level rate limiting is per instance; add a Vercel Firewall rate-limit rule for distributed enforcement

## Commands
```bash
cd god-squad
npm install
npm run dev          # localhost:3001
npm run build        # production build
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript check
```
